title: Acoustic classification and localisation of sound sources for autonomous vehicles using Machine learning
summary: Our project seeks to apply machine learning techniques to help separate, classify and localise sounds of objects in a carâ€™s vicinity. With these capabilities, a car is more well-informed of its surroundings and can act accordingly (such as responding and making way for police cars, ambulances and fire trucks).
